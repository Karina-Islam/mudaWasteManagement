<h1>Why Remove Waste?</h1>  
<p>Your company's Profit is your selling price less your costs, no matter how you think about the selling price it is very much dictated by the market not by yourself. If you charge too much then your customers will go elsewhere, even if you charge too little you may lose customers as they will perceive there may be something wrong with what you are offering. Therefore the only way you have to improve your profits are to reduce your costs; this means removing all elements of waste from your processes.
In addition to improving your profits you will find that waste has a major impact on your customer’s satisfaction with your products and services. Your customers want on time delivery, perfect quality and at the right price. Something that you cannot achieve if you allow the 7 wastes to persist within your processes.</p>

  <h1> How to Eliminate & Types of Wastes </h1>
<p>
Eliminating the seven wastes is something that can be done through the implementation of Lean and the various lean tools, however the focus of your implementation should not be to identify and remove waste. Instead you should use the principles of lean manufacturing to identify value according to the customer and make those value adding processes flow through your organization at the pull of the customer. This approach helps you to make your value adding processes more efficient and causes the waste to literally “dissolve.”
Approaching lean from a perspective of removing the 7 wastes rather than making value flow however usually ends up with us making non-value adding processes more efficient and we get better and better at doing things that the customer does not want. To eliminate the 7 wastes of lean we have to focus on the lean principles and value as perceived by our customers </p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong> Lean tools</strong> : to make any process better, faster, cheaper</li>
  <li><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong> : in these method waste are not direct targets for continuous improvement. When waste are like to symptoms then it need to eliminate root causes.</li>
  <li><strong>Six Sigma templates</strong>  : to solve quality problems</li>
  <li> <strong>Value Stream Mapping templates</strong> : for strategic alignment </li>
  <li><strong>Lean Management Systems</strong> : for lean leadership</li>
  
</ul>
