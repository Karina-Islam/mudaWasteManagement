  <h1> MUDA: Waste Management</h1>
<p> Muda (無駄) is a Japanese word meaning "futility; uselessness; wastefulness", and is a key concept in the Toyota Production System (TPS) as one of the three types of deviation from optimal allocation of resources (the others being mura and muri). Waste reduction is an effective way to increase profitability. </p>
<p> Muda is any activity or process that does not add value; a physical waste of your time, resources and ultimately your money.</p>

<h1>What Exactly is Waste?</h1>
<p>The simplest way to describe waste is as “Something that adds no Value.” Our customers would not be happy to pay for any action that we take that does not add value to what they actually want and nor should we be.</p>
<p>Would you be happy if you received a bill in a restaurant that included a meal that was prepared in error? No; you would argue and demand that it was removed from your bill; yet if you buy a product in a store the price that you pay will contain costs that you would not want to pay. Would you want to pay for the machine operator's wages whilst they sat idle waiting for a delivery, or for the rework processes that had to be undertaken because the machine was incorrectly set, or even for storing your product for three months before it was delivered to the store?  These wastes are included within the cost of your products, either inflating the price you pay or reducing the profit of the company.</div>
